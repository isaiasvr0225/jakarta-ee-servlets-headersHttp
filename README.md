Jakarta EE Headers HTTP with Servlets.

HTTP headers play a crucial role in communication between a client (like your web browser) and a server. They provide additional information about the request or the response, helping both sides understand and process the data more effectively. Here are a few reasons why HTTP headers are important:

1. **Communication Control:** Headers allow the client and server to negotiate and agree on the format of the data being sent. For example, the `Content-Type` header informs the recipient about the type of data in the body (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML).

2. **Caching:** Headers like `Cache-Control` and `Expires` help in controlling caching mechanisms, allowing clients to cache responses and reduce the need for redundant data transfers.

3. **Security:** Certain headers enhance security by preventing malicious activities. For instance, the `Strict-Transport-Security` header ensures that a website is only accessed over HTTPS.

4. **Authentication:** Headers like `Authorization` are essential for implementing authentication mechanisms, allowing secure access to resources.

5. **Redirection:** Headers like `Location` are used to handle redirects. When a resource has moved, the server can inform the client about the new location using this header.

6. **Compression:** Headers like `Content-Encoding` allow the server to indicate whether the response is compressed, helping in efficient data transfer.

7. **Cookies:** The `Set-Cookie` header is crucial for managing user sessions and storing small pieces of data on the client side.

8. **Language and Encoding:** Headers like `Accept-Language` and `Accept-Encoding` enable the client to communicate its preferences to the server, allowing content negotiation based on language or encoding.

In summary, HTTP headers provide a structured way for clients and servers to exchange information, enabling efficient and secure communication on the web.

So in this project I made a page wich download an Excel file, this using servlets in Jakarta EE 9, when the link is clicked automatically an Excel file is downloaded. Likewise, I made a page wich reloads every second.
